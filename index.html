<p1><font size="5.0"><center>The utopizing tension of the origins of design
must be recovered. If this is the allegory
of a possible transformation, then it should
reach as many people as possible.
Those people who build our environment
in a state of alienation and thus remain
partially responsible of its transformation.
The mechanisms lead by the IT revolution
are presently devouring all ideas to vomit
sellable goods. To begin with, in the next
decades we must find the right ways to isolate
from this redundancy the transformation ideas.
In order to achieve that we must separate
them from all those ideas that are generated
by irresponsible anarchies that deny and
trivialize the drive towards the utopia, thus
making it impossible to get people involved.
In the meanwhile, it might be worth
to generalize the idea that: every project
works towards ethics (which can be
compared to the Hippocratic Oath.).</font></center></p1>
